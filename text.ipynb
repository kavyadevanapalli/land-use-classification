    "I have used decision tree classifier to classify the land. I have taken the given training data, done the preprocessing(removed all null values). I thought it is better to remove the null values. if we replace them with any value it may lead to classify wrongly as the ndvi values for each class  I have divided the data into training and test sets. I have trained the model with training data then tested the results for test data. I have got good accuracy for the test data.  \n",
